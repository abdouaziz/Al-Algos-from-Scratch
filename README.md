# Al-Algos-from-Scratch
Some basic AI/ML/DL algorithms implemented from scratch for understanding purposes. Here I will be using only numpy and some basic libraries only.


### Algorithms implemented:
1. Basic Deep Neural Network using Gradient Descent for Backpropogation.
2. Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent
3. Linear Regression using Gradient Descent 
3. Decision Tree (Soon)
4. Support Vector Machines (Soon)
5. Naive Bayes (Soon)
6. KNN (Soon)
7.
